# JS-Learning
Learning JavaScript – documenting my progress with examples and projects.

## Introduction

**JavaScript (JS) is a high-level, lightweight, and interpreted programming language primarily used to make web pages interactive.**

Yeh ek aisi language hai jo webpages ko sirf dekhne layak nahi, balki use karne layak banati hai — jaise forms ka validation, sliders, popups, etc.

## JavaScript in Web Development

**JavaScript allows static HTML pages to behave dynamically.**

Socho ek simple page jahan sirf text hai — usme agar user kuch input kare ya kisi button pe click kare aur turant kuch response aaye, toh yeh kaam JavaScript karta hai.

## Getting Started

**JavaScript runs directly in the browser without the need for any additional setup.**

Bas ek modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.) aur ek simple text editor (VS Code best rahega) chahiye shuru karne ke liye. Koi installation ka jhanjhat nahi!

## A Brief History

**JavaScript was developed by Brendan Eich in 1995 for the Netscape browser. It was initially called Mocha, then LiveScript, and finally JavaScript — a strategic naming move inspired by Java’s popularity at the time.**

Naam se confuse mat ho — Java aur JavaScript alag languages hain. JavaScript ko popular banane ke liye us waqt Java ka naam chipka diya gaya tha.

## What is ECMAScript?

**JavaScript is based on the ECMAScript (ES) standard. This standard defines how the language should behave, what syntax it follows, and what features it includes.**

Har naye version ke sath naye features add hote gaye hain jo JavaScript ko aur zyada powerful aur developer-friendly banate hain.

### Some Key Versions:

* **ES5 (2009)**: Introduced strict mode, JSON support
* **ES6 (2015)**: Introduced `let`, `const`, arrow functions, promises, classes, and template literals
* **Later Versions** (ES7 onward): Added async/await, spread operator, and more modern capabilities

## Relevance Today

JavaScript is the backbone of modern web development. It is used both on the frontend (with frameworks like React, Angular, Vue) and backend (with Node.js).

**Aaj ke zamane me web development ka matlab hi JavaScript se hai — chahe user interface banana ho ya server-side logic likhna ho.**
